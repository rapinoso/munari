          <h3>Più e meno</h3>
          <p>
            The visual game “Plus and minus” consists of 72 cards, each having a
            different image. Many of these images (48) have a transparent
            background and can thus be superimposed to compose other more
            complex images and stimulate the child’s creative capacities.
            Superimposing some of the tree images creates a wood. Superimposing
            on the wood the image of rain or that of the sun or moon, or of a
            flight of birds, or of a passing dog, and so on, the total image can
            be continuously modified.

            The billboard designed by Bruno Munari for Campari is closely
            related to the opening of the M1 subway line in Milan, in November
            1964: it is in fact a poster that considers a mobile, and at the
            same time fragmented, vision because, as the artist himself affirms,
            it does not lose “its strenght even if it is partially glimpsed,
            even if groups of people partially cover it, or if you look at it
            from the moving subway cars”

            The PREBOOKS (a cult nowadays), published for the first time by
            Bruno Danese in 1980, are a series of twelve small books ideally
            dedicated to very young children which have not yet learned how to
            read or write. These twelve little books (10 x 10 cm) are designed
            to t into small hands and come in many different and unusual
            colours, bindings and materials. They offer a variety of stimuli,
            sensations and emotions, raising from perceptions and images: “they
            should give the sensation that books are indeed objects made like
            this and that they contain a wide array of surprises. Culture comes
            out of surprises, which are things that were unknown before” (B.
            Munari).

          <h3>Design as Art</h3>
          <p>
            One of the last surviving members of the futurist generation, Bruno
            Munari's Design as Art is an illustrated journey into the artistic
            possibilities of modern design translated by Patrick Creagh
            published as part of the 'Penguin on Design' series in Penguin
            Modern Classics. 'The designer of today re-establishes the long-lost
            contact between art and the public, between living people and art as
            a living thing'

          <p>
            "This thing with forks is a game, a sort of mental exercise, the
            same as the one I play with children". Thanks to his intelligent and
            unexpected doodles, Bruno Munari knew how to discover the unusual in
            the mundane. And so a common object like the fork, through a simple
            exercise of the imagination, can become a hand. Actually, lots of
            hands.

          <h3>Nella notte buia</h3>
          <p>
            Published for the first time in 1956. Thanks to its intrinsic
            strength and the exceptional timelessness of the pictures, the book
            has now become a cult and a reference point in children's
            publishing. The different types of paper used, simplicity of the
            images and holes that echo the story lead the reader along the
            mysterious path of the "darkness of the night".
